# prework-study-guide webpage
A study guide for course prework

## Description
The Prework study guide was devoloped to help students on the Front end web developer bootcamp learn and store notes about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. We were encouraged to add our notes to the project to have something to refer to later, to learn more about each topic and to share what we had done with others.

## Installation

## Usage

The project contains study notes on four topics; HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
In order to use it as intended you will need to open up the DevTools Concole, where you should see the Javascript at work. You can open this using the shortcut CTRL + Shift + I on Windows or CMD + Shift + I if you use a MAC. You can also get there through inspecing the page by right clicking and going to Inspect (Element)
Once DevTools is open you will see messages coded with JavaScript that should greet you and randomly suggest a topic to study. It will change randomly each time you refresh the page so you will always have somewhere to start.
